This problem is similar to traverse through all nodes of a tree. -> Using recursion
We iterate among each directory, keep track of the files thay match the desired pattern, then keep on going searching its sub directories by using recursion.

Time and Space Complexity:
Time O(n\*m) with n be the depth and m be the width of folders.
Space O(n) with n be the number of found files.
